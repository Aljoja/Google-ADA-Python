    "# String indexing and slicing\n",
    "As you know, strings are an important class of data because they represent text. Data professionals encounter strings all the time, so it’s important to become familiar with different ways of manipulating and working with them. This reading will review the string formatting techniques you’ve learned and also introduce you to regular expressions. \n",

    "Indexing refers to accessing a single element of a sequence by its position. In Python, the first element of any sequence has an **index of zero**. This means Python uses zero-based indexing. Numerous other programming languages also use zero-based indexing, but not all of them do. Some languages use one-based indexing, such as R, Julia, and Sass. \n",

    "Indexing and slicing are powerful tools in Python that allow you to access specific elements or parts of a sequence. Both indexing and slicing use square brackets. Remember that in a slice the starting index is inclusive and the stopping index is exclusive, and that negative indices count from the end of the sequence. With these tools, you can manipulate strings and other iterable sequences to perform a wide variety of operations, making you a more proficient data professional."
