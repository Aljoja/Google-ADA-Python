    "# Tableau Public overview\n",
    "As you have been learning, Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool used by data professionals around the world. If you have taken the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, then you should already be familiar with Tableau. If you haven’t completed the Data Analytics Certificate, you can review resource materials below and linked in other videos. The Tableau software is available for free through its browser version, which allows learners like you to test out the capabilities of the software in a limited capacity. In this reading, you will be given an overview of Tableau Public, the free use, basic version of this visualization software.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reviewing the fundamentals of Tableau Public**\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn about the basic structure of the **data source** and **design** screens featured in Tableau Public. The data source page is used for inputting or connecting to the data, and the design page is used for plotting and creating data visualizations. Both are needed to successfully design impactful and compelling data visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To review the Tableau Public setup process, refer to the reading about [how to sign on to Tableau Public](https://www.coursera.org/learn/go-beyond-the-numbers-translate-data-into-insight/supplement/muYtK/how-to-sign-on-to-tableau-public).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data source page**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start designing visualizations, you’ll first need to upload your data. Since you’ve already set up your Tableau Public profile, all you need to do is log in and select Web Authoring under Create in the navigation bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Everything required for Tableau in this course can be completed with Web Authoring; you are *not* required to download the Tableau software. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tableau Public Web Authoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "Web authoring allows you to create visualizations directly from a web browser. Can you create a viz without downloading any software? Yes! Since you’ve already [set up your Tableau Public profile](https://www.tableau.com/community/blog/2022/9/beginners-guide-tableau-public), all you need to do is log in and select **Web Authoring** under **Create** in the navigation bar. For the purposes of this certificate program, you can perform everything you need in Tableau Public. The instructions in the following resources refer to Tableau Public.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tableau Desktop Public Edition**\n",
    "You can also [download](https://www.tableau.com/community/blog/2022/9/beginners-guide-tableau-public) the software directly to your Mac or PC. Select **Tableau Desktop Public Edition** under **Create** in the navigation bar on Public’s website. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Reminder: Tableau Public should only be used for analyzing and sharing public data.*** *All workbooks and datasets published will be freely accessible to anyone.* \n",
    "\n",
    "After you upload your dataset, you can perform the following steps outlined to match the circled numbers in the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Img](Picture1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following descriptions correspond to the image above. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. This left-hand pane includes your data connections and files. Here you will find all the files you upload in a list so that you can keep track of multiple files and/or multiple connections to different databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Just to the right of the data connections window is a list of all of the fields that Tableau Public has detected in a particular file. If you have multiple files uploaded, you can select the file from a dropdown to access each file’s fields. As you’ll learn in an upcoming video, Tableau’s fields are acquired from the data columns in your file. Tableau automatically sorts these fields into dimensions or measures and discrete or continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The biggest pane on the page, on the middle right, allows you to access all of the columns of your file as Tableau fields, including several rows of data. Unlike the pane to the left, this pane allows you to create new fields based on those already present, such as new calculation fields, groups, sets, or parameters (you will learn more about these features in upcoming videos). You may be prompted to select “update now” or “update automatically” in order to populate this pane with your data. If that’s the case, it is good practice to update automatically to ensure you’re consistently working with recent data. (For reference -- review the following image, after #5.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The blue button “Publish” in the upper right of the screen acts as your “save” button. Because Tableau Public is a browser-based platform, anything you create and want to save will be published to your public account. There are ways to password lock or hide data sources and data visualizations if desired, but Tableau Public only offers the Publish field for saving your work. When you click on the ‘Publish’ button, you may automatically be navigated to your data design page, which may be blank depending on your design progress. Do not be alarmed. Your latest dataset uploads or data designs were still saved; just navigate back to where you were last and continue editing your visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lastly, you will use the collection of buttons at the bottom left of the page to navigate to your data design page.  You’ll find button options for creating a new worksheet, a new dashboard, and a new story. These elements will be introduced in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Img](Picture2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data design page**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data design page is where your data visualizations will be built. To navigate to the data design page, click on ‘Sheet 1’ or create a new sheet as instructed in #5 on the previous corresponding image. When you first click to open a data design page, you may be prompted that Tableau is ‘Creating Extract’. That means that Tableau is extracting the providing data to be used in visualizations. This process may take several minutes. Here you will move your data source fields to appropriate shelves to build the type of visualization you want. You can build data visualizations or entire interactive  dashboards from this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Img](Picture3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following numbered items correspond to the numbers displayed in the Tableau workbook image above.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this pane on the far left, you will find your list of discrete and continuous dimensions and measures. You will move these variables to different panes on this page to build visualizations. You will learn more about these variables later. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the next pane just to the right, you’ll find “Pages,” “Filters,” and “Marks.” You can move any dimension or measure to these different fields to manipulate the data visualization. You will learn how to use these features in upcoming videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. At the top of the page, just under the menu bar, there are two empty rows that act as your main two shelves for moving your variable fields. The “Columns” and “Rows” shelves help you position your data visualization as desired. You’ll also notice above these rows a toolbar and menu full of other options for manipulating your data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the middle of the screen is the main viewing panel for your visualization. As you add elements and drag your dimensions and measures to different fields, you will notice the impact they have on your data visualization in this panel. In the upper right corner you will find your “Publish” button, which acts as the save button, and the “Show Me” dropdown. Under the “Show Me” dropdown, you will find a selection of data visualization types and guides for building each of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. When you’re ready to [save and share your work](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/publish_workbooks_tableaupublic.htm), publish it to your Tableau Public profile. View the options for publishing your work by clicking on the down arrow next to the “Publish” button on the top navigation bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other ways to review Tableau tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, if you have taken the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) program, you are already familiar with Tableau and Tableau Public.

    "By visiting [Tableau.com](https://www.tableau.com/), you’ll notice multiple product offerings, everything from Tableau Public (which is free) to Tableau Desktop, Tableau Mobile, and Tableau Server. Each product has its own use and specialization, but the main elements for data visualization are the same.
