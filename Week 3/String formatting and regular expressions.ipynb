    "# String formatting and regular expressions\n",
    "As you’ve learned, strings are a crucial class of data because they represent textual information. Data professionals encounter strings all the time, so it’s important to become familiar with different ways of manipulating and working with them. This reading will review the string formatting techniques you’ve learned, and also introduce you to regular expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### String formatting \n",
    "String formatting uses the `format()` method, which belongs to the string class. This method formats and inserts specific substrings into designated places within a larger string. It’s useful when you have reusable template text into which you want to insert specific changeable values, for example. `The format()` method is also useful when assigning the strings used to label charts and graphs you make. \n",

    "Notice the syntax. The `format()` function inserts its arguments into the braces within the string that it’s attached to. The order of insertion follows the order of the arguments. Also, this example includes a helpful trick. Sometimes you’ll encounter a very long string. Many editors will allow the string to keep extending to the right on a single line. This is impractical unless you have a very wide monitor, but 79 characters is a conventional maximum length for a single line of Python code. Enclosing your string in triple quotes lets you break the string over multiple lines.\n",
